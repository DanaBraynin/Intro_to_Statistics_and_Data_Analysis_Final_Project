# Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis with R Final Project
**By: Inbar Rodan and Dana Braynin**<br><br>
This project was done as part of an Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University.<br><br>
The goal of the project was to demonstrate and practice the different elements which are a part of most data analysis/data science projects.<br>
In this project we handled the different phases of a data analysis project: data import, data tidying, transforming variables, visualizing and modelling (hypothesis testing, regression, analysis of variance).<br><br>
Our project is based on a data from “Kaggle”: “Disney+ TV Shows and Movies”. This data set was created to list all shows available on Disney+ streaming and analyze the data to find interesting facts. This data was acquired in May 2022 containing data available in the United States.<br><br>
The project is in RStudio with R.<br><br>
The project achieved a score of 93. <br><br>
